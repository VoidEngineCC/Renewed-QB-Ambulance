# qb-ambulancejob (Optimized Version)

## Description
This is my edited version of the qb-ambulancejob script. Unlike others charging for basic modifications, I decided to release this for free. This code belongs **100% to me** and was initially developed as part of my unreleased server, **Dynasty Roleplay**. While this release isn't groundbreaking, it includes a feature that many seem to charge for and is more optimized than some existing edits.

### Key Feature
- **Death Communication Block**: When a player dies, they:
  - **Cannot hear anyone**
  - **Cannot talk**

This feature improves immersion and is a practical addition for roleplay servers.

## Why Release This?
Everyoneâ€™s doing basic edits and charging for them, so I decided to release something actually useful for free. Enjoy this optimized version and use it as you see fit.

## Installation
1. Download the script.
2. Replace or add it to your `resources` folder.
3. Add `ensure qb-ambulancejob` to your server configuration.
4. Restart your server or run `refresh` and `ensure qb-ambulancejob` in the server console.
